# Catchify JavaScript

Like the SASS, JavaScript should be genuinely useful across projects.  A module like `client-name-news-filtering.js` doesn't really fly in Catchify.  Is it a bird, is it a plane?  Nope, it doesn't fly... :boom:

## Coding Standards

Right now use the es6 [Airbnb style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/linters).

## Linting

Linting is with eslint, and is coupled into the `npm test` script for convenience.
